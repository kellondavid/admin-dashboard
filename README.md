Odin Project's Admin Dashboard Assignment

General Thoughts: Main purpose of the assignment was to utilize grids in CSS. The project wasn't too difficult, and I realized that I am a huge fan of grids. Grids seem a lot more intuitive to me than flexboxes, and it definitely has more utility as well. I'll probably be using grids often in future projects, so I'm glad I learned them!

What I learned:

- how to make grids (also utilizing repeat())
- how to position grids
- how to nest grids
- what 1fr is
- that grid can basically do everything that flexbox can
